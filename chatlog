### *Problem Statement:*
A recent network configuration change caused application connectivity failures, database query timeouts, and degraded system performance, impacting multiple teams. The issue was traced back to the network change during the MIM call.

### *Solution:*
The network team rolled back the recent configuration, restoring connectivity and resolving performance issues. All teams collaborated to monitor their respective systems, ensuring stability post-roll back.

### *Future Recommendations:*
1. *Change Management*: Implement stricter testing and approval processes for network changes, ensuring cross-team sign-off and simulation of real-world conditions.
2. *Enhanced Monitoring*: Use proactive monitoring and AI-driven anomaly detection to identify network issues early, with standardized post-change health checks.
3. *Cross-Team Coordination*: Regularly communicate and conduct failure simulation drills across teams to improve real-time incident response.
4. *Rollback Planning*: Automate and test rollback strategies to ensure quick recovery during any network-related disruptions.
